# social_media_resume
Everything you'd like to know about me before you interact with me

# What is this
This is my social media resume, not to be confused with my professional resume. I do not mind if professional contacts or potential employers see this.

# Epistimology
## Common Knowledge
A certain amount of facts are expected to be known by all educated people

## Cited
Something that can be cited is more true than something that can't be cited.

## Authority
Your status in society doesn't automaticly persuade me, it is a fairly small number of people whose opinion I automatically respect out of a sense of rank, generally because I've known this in real life for a while.

# Issue Goals
I'm somewhat sceptical of the possibility of persuasion. I think undecided people can be informed to take a stand on an issue. I think some decided people who disagree on issues can chat and discuss the pros and cons of issues, but this is unlikely to change minds.

I think a lot of people have "respect for autonomy issues" ie, they don't have a functional way to deal with people trying to persuade them, or even how to deal with people who are different as if difference alone is an act of persuasion.

# Metastands
These are big topic-clusters that roughly define modern "tribes" or in some cases line up with personality types.

## Political Specturum
By this typology I'm a "Solid Liberal": https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/quiz/political-typology/ I don't think peopel are persuadable unless they've never thought about it (teenagers) or people who happen to be somewhere where they don't have to have the same opinions of their village.

## Religion
I'm not a Christian, nor am I antheist, who I think mostly define themselves as not believing in a Christian god. I'm a secular Buddhist. Buddhism being so diverse, that doesn't say much, see my blog elsewhere for where I stand on doctrine and practice.

I think only people who are actively looking for a new religion are persuadable to become Buddhist, everyone else is just comparing notes or trying to be mean to folk outside of their religion or religious stance.

## Food
I'm vegan and I think only people who have never thought about their source of food & people who are concerned about their health. I think at best 1/3 of people might be persuadable to eat meat less, e.g. as little as twice a week, in part because that is how people ate 100 years ago.

## Language
I think everyone should be multilingual or know a few lingua francas or even Esperanto. There is nothing special about any particular language.

# Specific Issues
## Coronavirus
It is real, government policies should listen to the current best science on fighting it

## Gun Rights
I side with all the policy makers in west Europe, except Switzerland, and Japan. Only professionals need guns. In the US, I think bullets should be regulated because after decades of flooding the market with guns, the oversupply will last for decades, regardless to policy.

## Trade
I favor free trade and low tarrifs. The collosal economic waste of trade barriers impoverishes us all and causes countries to engage in economic waste on collosal scale with impacts for the environment.

## Child Care
The government should fund child care and reduce professional requirements for childcare. 

## College Costs
Student loans should be paid back as a percentage of income over a fixed number of years. This would take care of the problem of worthless diplomas that have no impact on lifetime earnings and overpriced diplomas that over promise and underdeliver. College has turned into a bizop fraud for many degrees.

## Health Care
Health care should have a public option & should be guaranteed by the federal government.

## Taxes
The rich should be taxed, but we should be realistic about the tax evading powers of the rich. Taxes should be highest in siutations where tax is hard to evade. 
Abortion Rights - Let women decide, make abortion legal, available and safe.

## Economy
A well regulated free economy is a good thing. There are no simple partisan rules of thumbs that always work. Most good policies are going to be hybrid left of center, right of center policies.

## Climate Change
Florida will eventually be flooded and disappear. To set all the carbon fuels on fire, slowly or quickly guarantees this. (Conservation is about burning it all slowly) I think society, worldwide will be incapable of stranding fossil fuel assets. If a miracle of cooperation could happen, all the remaining oil and coal should be left underground.

# Debates I've been in
I've gotten into URL wars with people, (exchanging URLs on an issue to cite material supporting my point) which is probably pointless, no one has time to read that much in the middle of a discussion. But not citing sources is just a discussion of uninformed opinion.
