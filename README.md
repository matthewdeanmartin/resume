# Resume Projects


## Angular Live Resume

Done and ready! Hire and fire Matt a few clicks!

## How this was made

This is a combination of AI and human written code. ChatGPT does a poor job of creating multifile coding
projects, so you have to debug and stitch them together. ChatGPT is functionally blind, so
I also had to pretty it up and wire it up to Github pages.

## TODO

Someday, I plan to write a resume fragment compiler to used in compiling custom resumes for job applications.
